# SaReGaMood
Mood-based playlist recommender for Indian Classical Music 

This project can be partitioned in four parts:
(1) database creation
(2) exploratory data analysis
(3) developing models
(4) validating models

The database is created on PostgreSQL and the code used for this are separate .py files, one for each functionality.
For someone who is interested in data sceince part of things, they can ignore the databse creation part.
For EDA, the IPython notebooks "Exploratory Data Analyis" and "Understanding Bias" would suffice. 
Models are developed and analyzed in IPython notebook "Unsupervised Clustering." 
Model is validated in Ipython notebook "Validation" along with two .py files that encode survey generated data.
