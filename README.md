# SaReGaMood
Mood-based playlist recommender for Indian Classical Music 

This project can be partitioned in four parts:
(1) database creation
(2) exploratory data analysis
(3) developing models
(4) validating models

Most of the database creation is based on PostgreSQL and teh code of this is a separate .py file for each functionality.
For EDA, the ipython notebooks "Exploratory Data Analyis" and "Understanding Bias" would suffice. 
Models are developed and analyzed in IPython notebook "Unsupervised Clustering." 
Model is validated in Ipython notebook "Validation" along with two .py files that encode survey generated data.
